<h3>Just I would love to say…it is AMAZING.</h3>
<p>< Salon's atmosphere ><br>
The store atmosphere and interior decoration are very fabulous.<br>
The tiffany blue door’s are so cute and I want to wish to be in such a room I get enthusiastic every time I go. It is a salon that you want to stay all the time, owner’s select items,a lot of sense packed up.<br>
<br>
< Hospitality ><br>
Very bright and full of happy aura of owner. There are a lot of people who can feel so positive just by meeting themselves. You should surely feel that that feeling will lead to beauty!<br>
And whatever you ask me will tell you very detailed.<br>
What I'm happy about is that it is better to tell you what is better not to see your skin. It is a professional woman who can be trusted more than anyone because you can do it so hard just to become beautiful without absolutely selling anything.<br>
<br>
< Facial ><br>
Every time I leave it at the Haute Couture Facial Course, I like the goodness of the scent during the treatment very much. And more than anything surprised by the difference in complexion before and after treatment.<br>
I also lost words that I could get to face more lifted and I made it so white.<br>
I feel that I'm moistly moistened from the back of my skin, I think that it is definitely more beautiful than when doing a foundation.<br>
<br>
< Coco oil mask ><br>
This pack is really extraordinary.You know I meant?Just...AWESOME.<br>
I love scent and texture also.<br>
I also like placing it on my skin longer than other packs. It is a secret pleasure that you can use it all over the body because plenty of beauty essence is included with the pack.<br>
Skin after packing will also be visible and will rise one way. Every time I use it as a pack I can not give away for the rest of my life.</p>

<h3>Totally NO PAIN.I finished repeating at the moment when I saw the mirror after finishing.</h3>
<p>< Salon's atmosphere ><br>
It is fashionable and cute in a store that is unimaginable as an esthetic salon, but I know very well about the interior. The floor where counseling is also a wonderful atmosphere, the tension rises before receiving the treatment! It is also saved that it is near from the station.<br>
<br>
< Hospitality ><br>
We will respond to detailed requests, such as want to drop every part or to this extent, so we can talk about your plan. The packs used during the procedure are also very polite, so they will explain each one individually, so you can receive the treatment with confidence.<br>
<br>
< Facial ><br>
When I was getting the treatment, my face was suck.Because the swelling was so terrible, I wanted to refresh my face line anyway.The haute Couture Facial Course is so amazing and gorgeous, everything is clear even that the roughness due to pollen, the swelling was also refreshing.Also, although I am very dry skin, I gently moisturized and so my skin was rich!It was confirmed at the moment when I saw the mirror after finishing.
<br>
<br>
< Body ><br>
I was particularly concerned about thigh hips and fat arms in the body, but if it is other esthetics, the part is decided and I can not make the part that I really want to do, but LIIL’s treatment is possible.<br>
We corresponded to detailed points such as. It was a pleasant feeling that my body temperature went up during the treatment and I could sweat a bit and I felt asleep as I slept on the way. <br>
Totally NO PEIN.but I’m sure for the effect.After treatment it was very refreshing and the thighs felt thinner once. When massaging with self at the house after the treatment, if the effect is more likely to come out, the way of home care was also taught! It is truly appreciated to be able to consult treatment details according to the condition of my body!</p>

<h3>I GAINED CONFIDENCE without wear make up!!</h3>
<p>< Facial ><br>
  I was able to feel the effect for the first time by receiving Facial Beauty with LllL! Sophisticated treatment, attentive customer service, good quality product. The dullness and stiffness of the skin I was concerned about has been improved, and I can feel confident in without wear makeup.
<br>
<br>
< Coco oil mask ><br>
Coco oil mask tightly adheres to the skin Puripuru feel is harsh ♡ The feeling of liquid is feeling good because it contains as it contains oil. After use the dullness was wiped out as if it got brighter about 3 tones rather than 1 tone. Because it also contains plenty of essence, you can use it for your upper body luxuriously!</p>

<h3>I was surprised by the visible change,IMMEDIATE EFFECT. </h3>
<p>< Body ><br>
  My body was coldness,swelling,visible cellulites before LllL’s treatment.I was surprised with the incredible treatment, after that still so warmed after hours of thet.Also got better in blood circulation!Of course I could relax comfortably during the treatment.<br>
  I was surprised at its immediate effect, as the body was tightened after that,even though it was not strongly massaged or squeezed up.That’s miracle!!<br>
  I got to the gym on the way home, but I always felt that the amount of sweat was totally different, metabolism also increased.<br>
  I definitely want to go again.</p>

<h3>It was precisely a GOT HAND!</h3>
<p>< Salon's atmosphere ><br>
Although it is near from the station, when entering the store you will be excited for the gorgeous and stylish interior that came to a different world.<br>
<br>
< Hospitality ><br>
Counseling is very polite.<br>
She listens to the requests very well. She also advised professionally, and she taught me exactly what I need, without any press selling.<br>
<br>
< Facial ><br>
Anyway the treatment is THE BEST. Actually ntil now, I went to various esthetics, but it was just a got hand ever.Seriously,the best ever.<br>
I was suffering from dry skin and dullness, sagging, but after the treatment…moisturized perfectly. I will definitely come back to the moon twice because the change is clearly understood.</p>

<h3>She is the exactly PROFESSIONAL.I was surprised when I was wondering about my troubles.</h3>
<p>< Salon's atmosphere ><br>
The salon’s place is very convenient in the Azabu Juban shopping street. The counseling room is bright, gorgeous and filled with girls' likes. The treatment room has a revolutionary atmosphere, and although it is natural, there is a high-class feeling and it is receiving treatment and it can be a very luxurious feeling.<br>
<br>
< Facial ><br>
I got a haute couture facial.This course is the best treatment here, firstly looking carefully at the condition of the skin,decide to ideal what I want to be. I was suffering from the repeated roughness of my cheeks.but I was amazed when I saw my skin and touched after the treatment..My mouse said wow!!wonderful! Like this.I got sterilized with ozone with a vulture in the facial, and peeled to remove for the needless keratin.Moisturizing and peeling pack are great.Became skin like tasty boiled eggs. This is a poreless! I gazed at a mirror and mirror,looked at my skin forever.<br>
<br>
< Coco oil mask ><br>
Anyway, luxurious! Because I am using COCO OIL MASK all over, I could feel the great adhesion and excellent moisturizing effect. Even if you are face feeling's going downwards, this pack will make perfect condition. And lots of plenty of beauty essence is contained,of course you can use the pack's extra essence serum for body care.I am caring for the upper body with the essence liquid remaining in the pouch ~ ♡<br>
I feel that the skin is tightened after packing and I think that one-tone brightness has improved.<br>
Here we go! Absolutely I use it on the day before the special day!!</p>

<h3>PlZ LOOK AT MY SKIN!!After finished,I wanted to meet someone.</h3>
<p>< Salon's atmosphere ><br>
Close to the Azabujuban station, this is the only salon on the 1 floor so I did not mind the surrounding sound,feel like a true private space. And inside was a beautiful and wonderful space than I was looking at in the pictures, there was comfort that I want to stay forever.<br>
<br>
< Hospitality ><br>
Anyway very very polite. I was looking for a cause of skin problems that I did not notice from my counseling on eating habits and living styles, and also on the causes of skin troubles.<br>
With a soft and kind attitude, I could relax and talk about the problems of the whole body, and also suggested a procedure suitable for it. I was also grateful to have taught about after-care at home and how to improve.<br>
<br>
< Facial ><br>
I was recommended by my friend, the treatment was exactly fantastic.Feeling was so good. I was satisfied very much everything, not only skin treatment, I feel like so relief and relax in my inside space.<br>
My skin was bad condition at the day although the tone went up and swollen and the pores were also tightened and it was a finish that I wanted to see someone.<br>
Even though I was using the pack that I bought since I got home, there seemed to be no change in the skin as I had, and skin quality has changed.</p>

<h3>Obviously the amount of FAT has DECREASED</h3>
<p>< Salon's atmosphere ><br>
  Reception is luxurious and fashionable atmosphere! The treatment room was also cleanliness and it was a room that was able to receive treatment with relaxation.<br>
<br>
< Body ><br>
I'm totally depending for everything every time! My legs are always swelling cause on work, I mainly ask for legs.I can see the amount of fat clearly decreased before treatment!<br>
I feel that traveling for a long time on an airplane or the like has become more difficult to swell than before.<br>
Until I came to LllL, I was not interested in esthetics at all, but those who do the procedure go to because I can trust also from New York that the technology is properly acquired. <br>
I will keep going in the future!!</p>
